# Rivalry Club (Expo)

Modern rebuild of Rivalry Club using Expo and current Amplify/GraphQL standards.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run ios     # Run on iOS simulator
npm run android # Run on Android
```

## 🚀 Production Build & Deploy

### App Store

**To build and submit to App Store (TestFlight):**

```bash
npm run build:ios:local
```

This will:

- Build the iOS app for production
- Automatically submit to App Store Connect
- No prompts or manual steps required

The build will appear in TestFlight within ~15 minutes after the build completes.

### Play Store

**To build and submit to App Store (TestFlight):**

```bash
npm run build:android
```

This will:

- Build the Android app for production
- Download the app from (Expo)[https://expo.dev/accounts/davisomalley/projects/rivalry-club-expo/builds]
- Upload the app to a new release in (Google Play Dashboard)[https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/8278992728250171737/app/4974178153621674209/app-dashboard]

Give the link to testers to download from Google Play store

## Tech Stack

- **Expo** - Development framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **NativeWind v4** - Tailwind CSS for React Native
- **React Navigation** - Native stack navigation
- **Supabase** - Authentication (Expo Go compatible)
- **AWS Amplify Gen 2** - Backend services (GraphQL API, AppSync, DynamoDB)
- **React Query** - Data fetching and state management

## Authentication

This app uses **Supabase** for authentication instead of AWS Cognito because:

- ✅ Works seamlessly in Expo Go (no native module issues)
- ✅ Simpler setup and configuration
- ✅ Better developer experience for mobile apps

**Important:** User authentication is handled by Supabase, but all game data (fighters, rivalries, contests, tier lists) is stored in AWS DynamoDB via AppSync GraphQL API.

### Supabase Configuration

**Project Details:**

- Project URL: `https://ybmcuqkllbmqmwtpsgbj.supabase.co`
- Configuration file: `src/lib/supabase.ts`

**Making Changes to Authentication:**

1. **Supabase Dashboard:** [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. **Email Settings:** Authentication → Providers → Email
   - Email confirmation is disabled for instant sign-up
   - To enable email verification: Toggle "Confirm email" and save
3. **User Management:** Authentication → Users
   - View all registered users
   - Manually verify/delete users if needed

**How It Works:**

1. Users sign up/sign in through Supabase
2. Supabase user ID is stored in the AppSync `User` table's `awsSub` field
3. The `useAuthUser` hook automatically creates a User record in AppSync after Supabase authentication
4. All game data queries use the AppSync User record

### AWS Amplify (Data Only)

The app uses Amplify Gen 2 for the GraphQL API and data storage, but NOT for authentication.

**Configuration:**

- Backend outputs: `amplify_outputs.json`
- GraphQL schema: `amplify/data/resource.ts`
- API endpoint: AppSync in `us-east-1`

**To deploy backend changes:**

```bash
npm run amplify:deploy
```

## Development Status

✅ Basic Expo app created
✅ NativeWind configured
✅ AWS Amplify Gen 2 backend connected
✅ GraphQL schema configured
✅ Supabase authentication integrated
✅ Navigation structure
⏳ Core features (in progress)
