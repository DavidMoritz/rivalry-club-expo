Guideline 5.1.1(v) - Data Collection and StorageIssue Description

The app supports account creation but does not include an option to
initiate account deletion. Apps that support account creation must also
offer account deletion to give users more control of the data they've
shared while using an app.

Follow these requirements when updating an app to support account deletion:

- Only offering to temporarily deactivate or disable an account is
insufficient.
- If users need to visit a website to finish deleting their account,
include a link directly to the website page where they can complete the
process.
- Apps may include confirmation steps to prevent users from accidentally
deleting their account. However, only apps in highly-regulated industries
may require users to use customer service resources, such as making a phone
call or sending an email, to complete account deletion.

Next Steps

Update the app to support account deletion. If the app already supports
account deletion, reply to App Review in App Store Connect and identify
where to locate this feature.

If the app is unable to offer account deletion or needs to provide
additional customer service flows to facilitate and confirm account
deletion, either because the app operates in a highly-regulated industry or
for some other reason, reply to App Review in App Store Connect and provide
additional information or documentation. For questions regarding legal
obligations, check with legal counsel.
